#1 Use the each method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.

#7 What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

# An array is an ordered list and a has is a collection of key-value pairs.
# You extract elements of an array by their index and you extract values from a has by their key.

#8 Create a Hash, with one key-value pair, using both Ruby syntax styles.
hash = { name: "chris" }
other_hash = { :name => "steve" }

#9  1. Get the value of key `:b`.
#   2. Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`
#   3. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5
h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
puts
puts "#9 answers"
print "1. " 
puts h[:b]

h[:e] = 5
print "2. "
puts h

print "3. "
h.delete_if { |k, v| v < 3.5}
# multi line version
h.delete_if do |k, v|
  v < 3.5
end
puts
puts h.to_s

#10 Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)
hsh_arrays = {
  a: [1, 2, 3],
  b: [4, 5, 6],
  c: [7, 8, 9]
}

arr_hashes = [ {a: 1}, {b: 2}, {c: 3}]
puts
puts "#10 answers"

puts arr_hashes.to_s

#11 Given the following data structures. Write a program that copies the 
# information from the array into the empty hash that applies to the correct person.
contact_data = [
  ["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"],
  ["sally@email.com", "404 Not Found Dr.", "123-234-3454"]

contact_data.each_with_index do |info, index| 
  if index == 0

  elsif index == 1

  end

  contact[:email] = info[0]
  contact[:address] = info[1]
  contact[:phone] = info[2]
end

#12 Using the hash you created from the previous exercise, 
# demonstrate how you would access Joe's email and Sally's phone number?
puts
puts "#12 answers"
puts contacts["Joe Smith"][:email]
puts contacts["Sally Johnson"][:phone]

#13 Use Ruby's Array method delete_if and String method start_with? to 
# delete all of the words that begin with an "s" in the following array.
arr5 = ['snow', 'winter', 'ice', 'slippery', 'salted roads', 'white trees']
puts
puts "#13 answers"
arr5.delete_if { |word| word.start_with?('s') }

puts arr5.to_s

#14 Turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. 
# (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. Look into using 
# Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.
a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
  'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']
puts
puts "#14 answer"
a.map! do |words| 
  words.split(' ')
end

#15 What will the following program output?
hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}
# The output is 'These hashes are the same!' because a hash is not 
# ordered like an array is and the key-value pairs are identical.

#16 Challenge: In exercise 11, we manually set the contacts hash values 
# one by one. Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash 
# from exercise 11, and populate the associated data from the contact_data 
# array. Hint: you will probably need to iterate over 
# ([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful methods might be the 
# Array shift and first methods.
